# Map Editor Tool

A basis for a map editing tool to assist artists and designers to build 2D maps for games.

The goal was to create a controls based windows application to fill the role of a tool application that aids in the development or use of something else. The project had to incorporate 2D graphcs rendering, drag and drop functionality, as well as file I/O functionality to be able to save and load file formats.

This project gave me good undestanding on how event based windows applications worked as usually games would be polling based where everything is refreshed every game loop. This would be useful for when I want to develop a more conventional application such a mobile app for example.

I also made sure to get the user prompts of saving changes working correctly. It was quite satisfying when it all worked right.

The release of this application includes a demonstration map file and a couple tilesheet images to be loaded into the palette and painted with.
